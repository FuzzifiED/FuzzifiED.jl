# An introduction to the fuzzy sphere

## Introduction

### Conformal field theory

The conformal field theory (CFT) is one of the central topics of modern physics. It refers to a field theory that is invariant under conformal transformations that preserve the angles between vectors. In spacetime dimension $d>2$, the global conformation symmetry is generated by translation, rotation (in Euclidean signature, or Lorentz transformation in Lorentz signature), dilatation (scale transformation), and special conformal transformation (SCT). These transformations altogether form a group $\mathrm{SO}(d+1,1)$. The CFT operators must carry an irreducible representation of the conformal group. In particular, each operator must carry a $\mathrm{SO}(d)$ spin under the rotation, a scaling dimension $\Delta$ under dilatation. A special kind of operators that are invariant under SCT called « primaries » deserve particular attension. By acting the space derivatives on the primaries, the « descendants » are obtained. The conformal symmetry is the maximal spacetime symmetry that a field theory can have. The CFT is gives powerful prediction about the property of the field theory. In particular, conformal symmetry uniquely determines the form of two-point and three-point correlation functions. The three-point correlators contain a universal coefficient called the OPE coefficient $f_{\Phi_i\Phi_j\Phi_k}$ between three primary operators $\Phi_i,\Phi_j,\Phi_k$. The collection of scaling dimensions and the OPE coefficients $\{\Delta_{\Phi_i},f_{\Phi_i\Phi_j\Phi_k}\}$ are called the CFT data. With this knowledge, an arbitrary correlation function of a CFT can be calculated. 

The CFT has provided important insights into various fields of theoretical physics. In condensed matter physics, it has produced useful prediction about the critical phenomena. Many classical and quantum phase transitions are conjectured to be have emergent conformal symmetry in the IR. The universal critical exponents are directly determined by the scaling dimensions of the primary operators. _E.g._, in Ising transitions that spontaneously break $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry, most critical exponents are given by the scaling dimensions of the lowest $\mathbb{Z}_2$-odd operator $\sigma$ and $\mathbb{Z}_2$-even operator $\epsilon$, such as
```math 
\eta=2\Delta_\sigma-1\qquad\nu=\frac{1}{3-\Delta_\epsilon}
```
The CFT is also closely related to string theory and quantum gravity high energy physics. In the string theory, The CFT is known to describe the 2d worldsheet ; in quantum gravity, the gravity theory in $(d+1)$-dimensional anti-de Sitter (AdS) space in the bulk is conjectured to be dual to a $d$-dimensional CFT on the boundary. Moreover, CFT has revealed some fundamental structures in the quantum field theory like the renormalisation group (RG) flow. It has been first discovered that there exists a $c$-function in 2d CFTs that is non-increasing along the RG flow and its value coincides with the central charge at conformal fixed points. Later, people have proven that there exist similar quantities in 3d and 4d CFTs, called the $F$-function and $a$-function. 

In 2d CFTs, besides the global conformal symmetry $\mathrm{SO}(3,1)$, there also exists an infinite dimensional local conformal symmetry. Altogether, they form the Virasoro algebra. The infinite dimensional conformal algebra has made many theories exactly solvable, especially the rational theories including the minimal models and the Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) theories. On the other hand, going to the higher dimensions, the CFTs are much less well-studied due to a much smaller conformal group. The existing methods include numerical conformal bootstrap and Monte Carlo lattice simulations. Numerical boostrap makes use of the global symmetry, consistency conditions such as reflection positivity, and a certain amount of assumptions to bound the conformal data. It has achieved great success in 3d Ising, $\mathrm{O}(N)$ Wilson-Fisher, Gross-Neveu CFTs, _etc._ On the other hand, one can study a CFT by constructing a lattice model that goes through a phase transition in the corresponding universality class, and study the phase transition by Monte Carlo simulation. The extraction of universal data usually involves complicated and expensive finite-size scaling, and only the lowest few CFT operators can be accessed in this way. Among these higher dimensional CFTs, we especially focus on $d=3$, as many Lagrangians in $d\ge 4$ flow to free theories. 

### Fuzzy sphere

In addition to these existing approaches, the _« fuzzy sphere regularisation »_ has recently emerged as a new powerful method to study 3d CFTs. The idea is to put an interacting quantum Hamiltonian on a 2-sphere $S^2$. This geometry preserves the full rotation symmetry (on the contrary, lattice models often only preserve a discrete subgroup). Moreover, when the system is tuned to a critical point or critical phase, combined with the time evolution direction, the system is described by a quantum field theory living on a generalised cylinder $S^2\times\mathbb{R}$, a manifold that is conformally equivalent to flat spacetime through the Weyl transformation
```math
    (\hat{\mathbf{n}},\tau)\in S^2\times\mathbb{R}\ \longmapsto\ r\hat{\mathbf{n}}\in\mathbb{R}^3,\qquad r=e^{\tau/R}
```
where $R$ is the radius of the sphere. This conformal transformation maps each time slice of the cylinder to a cocentric sphere in the the flat spacetime. 

Thanks to the conformal flatness that is not owned by other manifolds (_e.g._, a lattice model with periodic boundary condition lives on the manifold $(S^1)^d$ which is not conformally flat), we can make use of some nice properties of the conformal field theory, the most important one of which is the state-operator correspondance. Specifically, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the eigenstates of the critical Hamiltonian on the sphere and the CFT operators. The state and its corresponding operator has the same $\mathrm{SO}(3)$ spin and representation under global symmetry. More importantly, as the Weyl transformation maps the Hamiltonian $H$ corresponding to the time translation on the cylinder to the dilatation $D$ on the flat spacetime, the excitation energy of a state $|\Phi\rangle$ is proportional to the scaling dimension of the corresponding operator $\Delta_\Phi$
```math
    E_\Phi-E_0=\frac{v}{R}\Delta_\Phi
```
where $E_0$ is the ground state energy, $R$ is the radius of the sphere, and $v$ is the speed of light that is dependent on the microscopic model and is the same for different states. With this property, one can obtain the scaling dimensions simply by obtaining the energy spectrum of the quantum Hamiltonian without doing complicated finite size scalings, and one can obtain the OPE coefficients simply from the matrix element of a one-point correlator. This process will be described below.

A quantum Hamiltonian on a sphere enjoys the full rotation symmetry and the property of state-operator correspondence. However, it is difficult to put a lattice on the sphere due to the curvature (in particular the non-zero Euler characteristic), especially to recover an $\mathrm{SO}(3)$-symmetric theomodynamic limit. An alternative way we take is to fuzzify the sphere. We consider free charged particles moving on a sphere with a magnetic monopole with a flux $4\pi s$ ($s\in\mathbb{Z}/2$) placed at its centre. The monopole exerts a uniform magnetic field on the sphere, which modifies the single particle Hamiltonian and the single particle eigenstates. Now the single particle eigenstates form highly degenerate spherical Landau levels. The lowest Landau level has a degeneracy $(2s+1)$. By setting the single particle gap to be the leading energy scale, adding interactions, and projecting onto the lowest Landau level, we obtain a finite Hilbert space. For the sake of numerical simulation, the system is analoguous to a length-$(2s+1)$ spin chain with long range interaction, where different Landau level orbitals behave like the lattice sites. The difference is that the $(2s+1)$ orbital forms a spin-$s$ representation of the $\mathrm{SO}(3)$ rotation group, and in this way the continuous rotation symmetry is preserved. The word « fuzzy » means the non-commutativity, in our case, due to the presence of magnetic field. The non-commutativity provides a natural length scale which serves as a UV regulator of the quantum field theory. The radius of the sphere scales as $R\sim\sqrt s$. The thermodynic limit can be taken as $s\to\infty$, and we then recover a regular sphere without non-commutativity. 

The power of this approach has been first demonstrated in the context of the 3D Ising transition, where the presence of emergent conformal symmetry has been convincingly established and a wealth of conformal data has been accurately computed. The study has then been extended to accessing various conformal data such as the OPE coefficients, correlation functions, entropic $F$-function, conformal generators in the 3d Ising CFT, studying conformal defects and boundaries such as the magnetic line defect, various conformal boundaries in 3D Ising CFT, and realising various 3d CFTs such as Wilson-Fisher CFTs, $\mathrm{SO}(5)$ deconfined criticality, $\mathrm{Sp}(N)$ symmetric CFTs, _etc._ In the following sections, we shall review the existing works, technical details and the numerical methods. 

## Review of existing work

The study of 3d CFTs on fuzzy sphere can mainly be devided into four catagories :

1. Accessing various conformal data, 

2. Realising various 3d CFTs,

3. Studying conformal defects and boundaries, and 

4. Exploring applicable numerical techniques.

(The following sections are under revision)

### The pioneering work [[Zhu 2022](@ref References)]

This seminal paper opens a new avenue for studying 3d conformal field theories. It calculates and analyses the energy spectra at the 3d Ising transition, and explicitly demonstrate the state-operator correspondence as a fingerprint of conformal field theory, thus directly elucidates the emergent conformal symmetry of the 3d Ising transition.

### Accessing various conformal data

The first direction is to develop methods to calculate as many data and quantities of 3d CFTs on fuzzy sphere. Typically, these methods are tested on the simplest example of 3d Ising CFT. For many of those CFT data, fuzzy sphere is the first non-perturbative method to access them ; for the others, fuzzy sphere has achieved great consistency with previous methods such as quantum Monte Carlo and conformal bootstrap. So far, the accessible CFT data include operator spectrum, OPE coefficients, correlation functions, entropic $F$-function and conformal generators. 

1. __OPE coefficients__ [[Hu 2023Mar](@ref References)] This paper computes 17 OPE coefficients of low-lying CFT primary fields with high accuracy, including 4 that has not being reported before.

2. __Correlation functions__ [[Han 2023Jun](@ref References)] This paper computes the four-point correlators and verify the crossing symmetry. 

3. __Entropic $F$-function__ [[Hu 2024](@ref References)] This paper have performed the first non-perturbative computation of the $F$-function for the paradigmatic 3d Ising conformal field theory through entanglement entropy. 

4. __Conformal generators__ [[Fardelli 2024](@ref References), [Fan 2024](@ref References)] These papers investigate the conformal generators of translations and special conformal transformations which are emergent in the infrared and construct these generators using the energy momentum tensor.

### Realising various 3d CFTs

The second direction is study various other CFTs beyond 3d Ising. Fuzzy sphere has revealed many new information about these theories ; the previously known data are also consistent with fuzzy sphere results. So far, the accessible CFTs include $\mathrm{SO}(5)$ deconfined criticality, $\mathrm{O}(3)$ Wilson-Fisher and a series of new theories with $\mathrm{Sp}(N)$ symmetry. 

1. __The $\mathrm{SO}(5)$ deconfined criticality__ [[Zhou 2023](@ref References)] This paper provides clear evidence that the DQCP exhibits approximate conformal symmetry, and demonstrate that the DQCP is more likely pseudo-critical.

2. __The $\mathrm{O}(3)$ Wilson-Fisher__ [[Han 2023Dec](@ref References)] This paper design a microscopic model of Heisenberg magnet bilayer and study the underlying Wilson-Fisher $\mathrm{O}(3)$ transition through the lens of fuzzy sphere regularization. 

3. __A series of new $\mathrm{Sp}(N)$-symmetric CFTs__ [[Zhou 2024Oct](@ref References)] This paper discovers a series of new CFTs with global symmetry $\mathrm{Sp}(N)$ in the fuzzy sphere models that are closely related to the SO(5) deconfined phase transition, and are related to non-linear sigma model with a Wess-Zumino-Witten term and Chern-Simons-matter theories. The emergent conformal symmetry is numerically verified by observing the integer-spaced conformal multiplets and the quality of conformal generators. 

### Studying conformal defects and boundaries

Apart from the bulk CFTs, fuzzy sphere can also be used to study their conformal defects and boundaries. So far, the accessible defects/boundaries include the magnetic line defect of 3d Ising CFT, including its defect operator spectrum, correlators, $g$-function, defect changing operators, and its cusp, and the conformal boundaries of 3d Ising CFT.

1. __Conformal magnetic line defect__ [[Hu 2023Aug](@ref References)] This paper studies the magnetic line defect of 3D Ising CFT and clearly demonstrates that it flows to a conformal defect fixed point. The authors have identified 6 low-lying defect primary operators and extract their scaling dimensions, as well as computing one-point bulk correlators and two-point bulk-defect correlators.

2. __The $g$-function and defect changing operators__ [[Zhou 2024Jan](@ref References)] This paper have performed the non-perturbative computations of the scaling dimensions of defect-changing, creation operators and the $g$-function for the pinning defect in 3d Ising model. 

3. __Cusp__ [[Cuomo 2024](@ref References)] This paper study the general properties of the cusp anomalous dimension and in particular calculates the pinning field defects in the 3d Ising model on fuzzy sphere.

4. __Conformal boundaries of 3d Ising CFT__ [[Zhou 2024Jul](@ref References), [Dedushenko 2024](@ref References)] These papers demonstrates that conformal field theory (CFT) with a boundary, known as surface CFT in three dimensions, can be studied with the setup of fuzzy sphere, and in particular in the example of surface criticality, proposes two schemes by cutting a boundary in the orbital space or the real space to realise the ordinary and the normal surface CFTs on the fuzzy sphere.

### Other works on the fuzzy sphere

So far, the numerical methods that has been applied to fuzzy sphere to include exact diagonalisation (ED), density matrix renormalisation group (DMRG) and determinant quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC). The former two has been reviewed in previous sections.

1. __Quantum Monte Carlo on fuzzy sphere__ [[Hofmann 2023](@ref References)] This paper presents a numerical quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) method for simulating the 3D phase transition on the recently proposed fuzzy sphere.

2. __Ising CFT on top of FQHE state__ [[Voinea 2024](@ref References)]

## Model construction 

### Projection onto the lowest Landau level

To build the setup of fuzzy sphere, we consider a sphere with radius $R$ and put a $4\pi s$-monopole at its centre. Consider free electrons moving on the sphere. The monopole will modify the single particle Hamilltonian. 

```math
    H_0=\frac{1}{2MR^2}(\partial^\mu+iA^\mu)^2
```

where $\mu=\theta,\phi$ and we take 

```math
    A_\theta=0, A_\phi=-\frac{s}{R}\operatorname{ctg}\theta
```

The eigenstates of the Hamiltonian are the monopole spherical harmonics

```math
    Y_{lm}^{(s)}(\hat{\mathbf{r}}),\quad l=s,s+1,\dots,\quad m=-l,\dots,l-1,l
```

with the eigenenergies 

```math
    E_l=\frac{1}{2MR^2}(l(l+1)-s^2)
```

Each level, known as a Landau level, has a degeneracy of $(2l+1)$. Specifically, the wavefunctions on the lowest Landau level (LLL) $l=s$ is easy to write out :

```math
    Y_{sm}^{(s)}(\hat{\mathbf{r}})=C_me^{im\phi}\cos^{s+m}\frac{\theta}{2}\sin^{s-m}\frac{\theta}{2},\quad C_m=\frac{1}{{\sqrt{4\pi\Beta(s+m+1,s-m+1)}}}
```

where $C_m$ is the normalising factor, and $\Beta$ is the Euler's beta function. The LLL has a degeneracy $N_m=2s+1$.

We now consider $N_f$ flavours of fermions moving on the sphere, characterised by the second-quantised fermion operator $\hat{\psi}_f(\hat{\mathbf{r}})$, with a flavour index $f=1,\dots,N_f$. We partially fill the lowest Landau level and set the single energy gap to be much larger than the scale of interaction $H_0\gg H_\mathrm{int}$, so that the quantum fluctuation can be constrained on the lowest Landau level. In practice, we often fill integer number of flavours $N_e=kN_m$ ($k\in\mathbb{Z}$) so that a quantum Hall ferromagnet (_i.e._, the state where integer number of LLLs are filled) is preferred in the absence of interaction, for which the charge degree of freedom is gapped and will not couple strongly to the CFT degree of freedom in the presence of the interaction.  

We then project the system onto the LLL. Technically, this can be done by write the fermion operators in terms of the annihilation operators of the LLL orbitals
```math
    \hat{\psi}_f(\hat{\mathbf{r}})=\sum_{m=-s}^s Y^{(s)}_{sm}(\hat{\mathbf{r}})\hat{c}_{mf}
```
where $\hat{c}^{(\dagger)}_{mf}$ annihilates/creates an electron with $L^z$-quantum number $m$ at the $f$-th flavour of the lowest Landau level. In the following sections, we will omit the hats on the operators.

### Density operator

The simplest building block of an interacting many-body Hamiltonian is density operators, which are local fermion bilinears. 

```math
    n_M(\hat{\mathbf{r}})=\psi_{f'}^\dagger(\hat{\mathbf{r}})M_{f'f}\psi_f(\hat{\mathbf{r}})
```

Here the matrix insertion $M$ put the density operators at a certain representation of the flavour symmetry. For example, for a 2-flavour system, $M$ can be taken as the Pauli matrices $\mathbb{I},\sigma^x,\sigma^y,\sigma^z$ ; for a system with $N_f$ flavours in the fundamental representation of $\mathrm{SU}(N_f)$ flavour symmetry, one can put $n_M$ in the singlet or adjoint representation 
```math
    \begin{aligned}
        n_S(\hat{\mathbf{r}})&=\psi_{c}^\dagger(\hat{\mathbf{r}})\psi^c(\hat{\mathbf{r}})\\
        n_a{}^b(\hat{\mathbf{r}})&=\psi_{a}^\dagger(\hat{\mathbf{r}})\psi^b(\hat{\mathbf{r}})-\tfrac{1}{N}\delta_{a}{}^b\psi_c^\dagger(\hat{\mathbf{r}})\psi^c(\hat{\mathbf{r}})
    \end{aligned}
```

Like the fermion operator, the density operator can also be expressed in the orbital space. 

```math
    n_M(\hat{\mathbf{r}})=\sum_{lm}Y_{lm}(\hat{\mathbf{r}})n_{lm}
```

Conversely,

```math
    \begin{aligned}
        n_{lm}&=\int\mathrm{d}^2\hat{\mathbf{r}}\,\bar{Y}_{lm}n_M(\hat{\mathbf{r}})\\
        &=\int\mathrm{d}^2\hat{\mathbf{r}}\,\bar{Y}_{lm}\left(\sum_{m_1}\bar{Y}^{(s)}_{sm_1}c^\dagger_{m_1f_1}\right)M_{f_1f_2}\left(\sum_{m_2}Y^{(s)}_{sm_2}c_{m_1f_2}\right)\\
        &=\sum_{m_1m_2}c^\dagger_{m_1f_1}M_{f_1f_2}c_{m_1f_2}\int\mathrm{d}^2\hat{\mathbf{r}}\,\bar{Y}_{lm}\bar{Y}^{(s)}_{sm_1}Y^{(s)}_{sm_2}\\
        &=\sum_{m_1}c^\dagger_{m_1f_1}M_{f_1f_2}c_{m+m_1,f_2}(-1)^{s+m+m_1}(2s+1)\sqrt{\frac{2l+1}{4\pi}}\begin{pmatrix}s&l&s\\m_1&m&-m_1-m\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}s&l&s\\m_1&m&-m_1-m\end{pmatrix}
    \end{aligned}
```

Here we have used [various properties of the monopole spherical harmonics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin-weighted_spherical_harmonics)
```math
    \begin{aligned}
        \bar{Y}_{lm}^{s}&=(-1)^{s+m}Y_{l,-m}^{(-s)}\\
        \int\mathrm{d}^2\hat{\mathbf{r}}\,Y_{lm}^{(s)}\bar{Y}_{lm}^{(s)}&=\delta_{ll'}\delta_{mm'}\\
        \int\mathrm{d}^2\hat{\mathbf{r}}\,Y_{l_1m_1}^{(s_1)}Y_{l_2m_2}^{(s_2)}Y_{l_3m_3}^{(s_3)}&=\sqrt{\frac{(2l_1+1)(2l_2+1)(2l_3+1)}{4\pi}}\begin{pmatrix}l_1&l_2&l_3\\m_1&m_2&m_3\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}l_1&l_2&l_3\\-s_1&-s_2&-s_3\end{pmatrix}
    \end{aligned}
```
and $\begin{pmatrix}l_1&l_2&l_3\\m_1&m_2&m_3\end{pmatrix}$ is the [$3j$-symbol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3-j_symbol). In this way, we have fully expressed the density operator in terms of the operators in the orbital space $c^{(\dagger)}_{mf}$. 

### Density-density interaction

The most straightforward way to construct an interaction term is to add a density-density interaction potential $U(r)$. We note that this is not the simplest construction and we will present the simpler construction in terms of pseudopotentials in the next section. 

```math
    H_\mathrm{int}=\int\mathrm{d}^2\hat{\mathbf{r}}_1\,\mathrm{d}^2\hat{\mathbf{r}}_2\,U(|\hat{\mathbf{r}}_1-\hat{\mathbf{r}}_2|)n_M(\hat{\mathbf{r}}_1)n_M(\hat{\mathbf{r}}_2)
```
The interacting potentials can be expanded in terms of the Legendre polynomials 
```math
    U(\mathbf{r}_{12})=\sum_l\tilde{U}_lP_l(\cos\theta_{12})=\sum_{lm}\frac{4\pi}{2l+1}\bar{Y}_{lm}(\hat{\mathbf{r}}_1)Y_{lm}(\hat{\mathbf{r}}_2)
```
Conversely
```math
    \tilde{U}_l=\int \sin\theta_{12}\mathrm{d}\theta_{12}\,\frac{2l+1}{2}U(\mathbf{r}_{12})P_l(\cos\theta_{12})
```
Specifically, for local and super-local interactions
```math
    \begin{aligned}
        U(|\mathbf{r}_{12}|)&=\delta(\mathbf{r}_{12})&\tilde{U}_l&=2l+1\\
        U(|\mathbf{r}_{12}|)&=\nabla^2\delta(\mathbf{r}_{12})&\tilde{U}_l&=-l(l+1)(2l+1)
    \end{aligned}
```
By expanding the density operators into the orbital space and completing the integrals,
```math
    H_\mathrm{int}=\sum_{lm}\frac{4\pi \tilde{U}_l}{2l+1}n^\dagger_{M,lm}n_{M,lm}
```

For example, for the 3d Ising CFT, we take two flavours of fermions and write down an interaction 
```math
    H_\mathrm{int}=\int\mathrm{d}^2\hat{\mathbf{r}}_1\,\mathrm{d}^2\hat{\mathbf{r}}_2\,U(|\hat{\mathbf{r}}_1-\hat{\mathbf{r}}_2|)(n_0(\hat{\mathbf{r}}_1)n_0(\hat{\mathbf{r}}_2)-n_z(\hat{\mathbf{r}}_1)n_z(\hat{\mathbf{r}}_2))-h\int\mathrm{d}^2\hat{\mathbf{r}}\,n_x(\hat{\mathbf{r}})
```
where the density operators are defined as 
```math
    n_i(\hat{\mathbf{r}})=\psi^\dagger_{f'}(\hat{\mathbf{r}})(\sigma_i)_{f'f}\psi_f(\hat{\mathbf{r}})
```
and the potentials are taken as a combination of local and super-local interactions.

### Interaction in terms of pseudopotentials

Another way that is much more convenient to construct the interactions is through Haldane pseudopotential. To explain the idea, we take the 3d Ising model as an example. We first classify all the fermion bilinears $\lambda_{mm'ff'}c_{mf}c_{m'f'}$. To simplify the discussion, we can take a specific pseudo-spin index $\lambda_{mm'}c_{m\uparrow}c_{m'\downarrow}$. The fermion bilinears can be classified into irreducible representations of $\mathrm{SO}(3)$ rotation symmetry. Since $c_{mf}$ carries the spin-$s$ representation, the spin of its bilinear ranges from $0$ to $2s$ and takes integer values. The spin-$(2s-l)$ combination reads

```math
    \Delta_{lm}=\sum_{m_1}\langle sm_1,s(m-m_1)|(2s-l)m\rangle c_{m_1,\uparrow}c_{m-m_1,\downarrow}
```
where $m=-(2s-l),\dots,(2s-l)$, and the [Clebshbar-Gordan coefficients](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clebshbar-Gordan_coefficients) is related to the $3j$-symbol by
```math
    \langle l_1m_1,l_2m_2|lm\rangle=(-1)^{-l_1+l_2-m}\sqrt{2l+1}\begin{pmatrix}l_1&l_2&l\\m_1&m_2&-m\end{pmatrix}
```
A four-fermion interaction term can be formed by contracting these paring operators with its conjugate. 

```math
    H=\sum_lU_lH_l,\quad H_l=\sum_m\Delta_{lm}^\dagger\Delta_{lm}
```
Putting these altogether, the interaction Hamiltonian can be expressed as 
```math
    H=\sum_{l,m_1m_2m_3m_4}U_lC^l_{m_1m_2m_3m_4}c^\dagger_{m_1\uparrow}c^\dagger_{m_2\downarrow}c_{m_3\downarrow}c_{m_4\uparrow}-h\sum_m(c_{m\uparrow}^\dagger c_{m\downarrow}+\mathrm{h.c.})
```
where the matrix elements are 
```math
    C^l_{m_1m_2m_3m_4}=\delta_{m_1+m_2,m_3+m_4}\langle sm_1,sm_2|(2s-l)(m_1+m_2)\rangle\langle sm_3,sm_4|(2s-l)(m_3+m_4)\rangle
```
The coupling strength $U_l$ of the spin-$(2s-l)$ channel is called the Haldane pseudopotentials. 

We need also to consider the constraint that the two fermions must be anti-symmetrised : for even $l$, the orbital index is symmetrised, so the spin index must be antisymmetrised, so the two fermions form a spin-singlet which is invariant under the $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ transformation ; for odd $l$, the orbital index is anti-symmetrised, so the spin index is symmetrised, breaking the flavour symmetry from $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ to $\mathbb{Z}_2$. 

The fermion bilinears with other pseudo-spin configurations $\lambda_{mm',\pm}(c_{m\uparrow}c_{m'\uparrow}\pm c_{m\downarrow}c_{m'\downarrow})$ can be analysed in a similar way. After that, we have enumerated all possible four-fermion interaction terms. 

For systems with more complicated continuous symmetries, classification in terms of representation of flavour symmetry must also be considered, and the indices must be overall antisymmetrised. We explain that through the example of a system with $2N$ flavours that live in the fundamental representation of an $\mathrm{Sp}(N)$ global symmetry [[Zhou 2024Oct]](@ref References). We shall show that all the allowed terms are 

```math
    H=\sum_{\substack{l\in\mathbb{Z}\\m_1m_2m_3m_4}}U_lC^l_{m_1m_2m_3m_4}c^\dagger_{m_1a}c^\dagger_{m_2b}c_{m_3b}c_{m_4a}-\frac{1}{2}\sum_{\substack{l\in\mathbb{2Z}\\m_1m_2m_3m_4}}V_lC^l_{m_1m_2m_3m_4}\Omega_{aa'}\Omega_{bb'}c^\dagger_{m_1a}c^\dagger_{m_2a'}c_{m_3b'}c_{m_4b}
```

To find out all the four-fermion interactions allowed by the rotation symmetry $\mathrm{SO}(3)$ and global symmetry $\mathrm{Sp}(N)$, we classify all the fermion bilinears $c_{m_1a}c_{m_2b}$ into irreducible representations (irrep) of $\mathrm{SO}(3)\times\mathrm{Sp}(N)$. For each irrep, by contracting the bilinear with its Hermitian conjugate, we obtain an allowed four-fermion interaction term. Each fermion carries $\mathrm{SO}(3)$ spin-$s$ and $\mathrm{Sp}(N)$ fundamental. For the rotation symmetry $\mathrm{SO}(3)$, the bilinear can carry spin-$(2s-l)(l=0,\dots,2s)$ represetation ; for even $l$, the orbital indices are symmetrised ; for odd $l$, the orbital indices are antisymmetrised. For the global symmetry $\mathrm{Sp}(N)$, the bilinear can carry singlet $\mathrm{S}$, traceless antisymmetric rank-2 tensor $A$ and symmetric rank-2 tensor $T$ representation ; for $S$ and $A$, the flavour indices are antisymmetrised ; for $T$, the flavour indices are symmetrised. As the two fermions altogether should be antisymmetrised, the allowed combinations are 

Case 1. $\mathrm{Sp}(N)$ singlet and $\mathrm{SO}(3)$ spin-$(2s-l)$ with even $l$, the bilinears are 
```math
    \Delta_{lm}=\sum_{m_1m_2}\langle sm_1,sm_2|(2s-l)m\rangle\Omega_{aa'}c_{m_1a}c_{m_2a'}\delta_{m,m_1+m_2}
```
The corresponding interaction term $H_{S,l}=\sum_m\Delta_{lm}^\dagger\Delta_{lm}$ is the even-$l$ pseudopotential for the $V$-term.

Case 2. $\mathrm{Sp}(N)$ antisymmetric and $\mathrm{SO}(3)$ spin-$(2s-l)$ with even $l$, the bilinears are 

```math
    \Delta_{lm,[ab]}=\sum_{m_1m_2}\langle sm_1,sm_2|(2s-l)m\rangle\left(c_{m_1a}c_{m_2b}-c_{m_1b}c_{m_2a}-\tfrac{1}{N}\Omega_{ab}\Omega_{cc'}c_{m_1c'}c_{m_2c}\right)\delta_{m,m_1+m_2}.
```
The corresponding interaction term $H_{A,l}=\sum_m\Delta_{lm,[ab]}^\dagger\Delta_{lm,[ab]}$ is the even-$l$ pseudopotential for the $U$-term.

Case 3. $\mathrm{Sp}(N)$ symmetric and $\mathrm{SO}(3)$ spin-$(2s-l)$ with odd $l$, the bilinears are 

```math
    \Delta_{lm,(ab)}=\sum_{m_1m_2}\langle sm_1,sm_2|(2s-l)m\rangle\left(c_{m_1a}c_{m_2b}+c_{m_1b}c_{m_2a}\right)\delta_{m,m_1+m_2}.
```

The corresponding interaction term $H_{T,l}=\sum_m\Delta_{lm,(ab)}^\dagger\Delta_{lm,(ab)}$ is the odd-$l$ pseudopotential for the $U$-term.

In summary, all allowed interactions are the $U_l$ terms with both even and odd $l$, and the $V_l$ terms with only even $l$.

We also note that each pseudopotential can correspond to a profile of interaction potential functions. The conversion between the pseudopotentials $U_l$ and the Legendre expansion coefficients of the potential function $\tilde{U}_l$ 
```math
    U(\mathbf{r}_{12})=\sum_l\tilde{U}_lP_l\cos\theta_{12}
```
is 
```math
U_l=\sum_k \tilde{U}_k(-1)^l(2s+1)^2\begin{Bmatrix}2s-l&s&s\\k&s&s\end{Bmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}s&k&s\\-s&0&s\end{pmatrix}^2
```
where $\{\dots\}$ is the $6j$-symbol. Specifically, a local interaction contains only pseudopotential $U_0$ ; a superlocal interaction of form $(\nabla^2)^l\delta(\mathbf{r}_{12})$ contains $U_0,U_1,\dots,U_l$. Here we give the expressions for the lowest pseudopotentials explicitly.
```math 
    \begin{aligned}
        U(\mathbf{r}_{12})&=\delta(\mathbf{r}_{12})&U_0&=\frac{(2s+1)^2}{4s+1}\\
        U(\mathbf{r}_{12})&=\nabla^2\delta(\mathbf{r}_{12})&U_0&=-\frac{s(2s+1)^2}{4s+1}&U_1&=\frac{s(2s+1)^2}{4s-1}.
    \end{aligned}
```
More details are given in [Fan 2024](@ref References).

### Local observables

(This section is under revision)

On the fuzzy sphere, the simplest local observable is the density operator. We consider the Ising model as an example specifically
```math
    n^i(\Omega)=\Psi^\dagger(\Omega)\sigma^i\Psi(\Omega)=\sum_{mm'}Y^{(s)}_{sm}(\Omega)\bar{Y}^{(s)}_{sm'}(\Omega)\mathbf{c}^\dagger_m\sigma^i\mathbf{c}_{m'}
```
where $i=x,z$. From the CFT perspective, the density operators are the superpositions of scaling operators with corresponding quantum numbers. In the leading order, they can be used as UV realisations of CFT operators $\sigma$ and $\epsilon$.
```math
\begin{aligned}
    n^x&=\lambda_0+\lambda_\epsilon R^{-\Delta_\epsilon}\epsilon+\lambda_{\partial_\tau\epsilon}R^{-\Delta_\epsilon-1}\partial_\tau\epsilon+\lambda_{T_{\tau\tau}}R^{-3}T_{\tau\tau}+\dots&\epsilon_\mathrm{FS}&=\frac{n^x-\lambda_0}{\lambda_\epsilon R^{-\Delta_\epsilon}}\nonumber\\
    n^z&=\lambda_\sigma R^{-\Delta_\sigma}\sigma+\lambda_{\partial_\tau\sigma}R^{-\Delta_\sigma-1}\partial_\tau\epsilon+\lambda_{\partial^2\sigma}R^{-\Delta_\sigma-2}\partial^2\sigma+\dots&\sigma_\mathrm{FS}&=\frac{n^z}{\lambda_\sigma R^{-\Delta_\sigma}}
\end{aligned}
```
The UV-dependent coefficients $\lambda_0,\lambda_\sigma,\lambda_\epsilon$ can be computed from the 1-point function. The subleading terms to the density operators contribute to the finite size corrections
```math
\begin{aligned}
    \epsilon_\mathrm{FS}&=\epsilon+\frac{\lambda_{\partial_\tau\epsilon}}{\lambda_\epsilon}R^{-1}\partial_\tau\epsilon+\frac{\lambda_{T_{\tau\tau}}}{\lambda_\epsilon}R^{-3+\Delta_\epsilon}T_{\tau\tau}+\dots\nonumber\\
    \sigma_\mathrm{FS}&=\sigma+\frac{\lambda_{\partial_\tau\sigma}}{\lambda_\sigma}R^{-1}\partial_\tau\sigma+\frac{\lambda_{\partial^2\sigma}}{\lambda_\sigma}R^{-2}\partial^2\sigma+\dots
\end{aligned}
```
where $R=N^{1/2}$ in the fuzzy sphere. 

### Conformal generators

(This section is under revision)

The conformal generator $\Lambda^\mu=P^\mu+K^\mu$ on the states is the $l=1$ component of the Hamiltonian density. For example, for Ising model, it is the local density operator and density-density interactions with some full derivatives
```math
    \mathscr{H}(\mathbf{r})=n_z\left(g_0+g_1\nabla^2\right)n_z-hn_x+g_{D,1}\nabla^2n_x+g_{D,2}\nabla^2n_z^2+\dots
```
where $g_{D,i}$ are undetermined constants that does not affect the Hamiltonian $H=\int\mathrm{d}^2\mathbf{r}\,\mathscr{H}$. We have only listed a few examples of the allowed full derivatives. The generator is expressed as 

```math
    \Lambda_m=P_m+K_m=\int\mathrm{d}^2\mathbf{r}\,Y_{l=1,m}(\mathbf{r})\mathscr{H}(\mathbf{r}).
```

To determine those constants, we consider another strategy by combining four fermion operators into $\mathrm{SO}(3)$ spin-1 operators. Similar to what we have done for Hamiltonian, we combine the fermion bilinears $\Delta_{lm}$.

```math
    \Lambda_m=\sum_{\substack{l_1l_2m_1m_2}}\tilde{U}_{l_1l_2}\Delta^\dagger_{l_1m_1}\Delta_{l_2m_2}\begin{pmatrix}
        2s-l_1&2s-l_2&1\\-m_1&m_2&m
    \end{pmatrix}+hn_{x,1m}
```
For $l_1\in2\mathbb{Z}$, the spin index in the pairing operator is anti-symmetrised ; For $l_1\in2\mathbb{Z}+1$, the spin index in the pairing operator is symmetrised. Therefore, $l_1-l_2\in2\mathbb{Z}$ for non-zero results. And since $|l_1-l_2|\leq 1$, we conclude $l_1=l_2$, so

```math
    \Lambda_m=\sum_{\substack{lm_1m_2}}\tilde{U}_{l}\Delta^\dagger_{lm_1}\Delta_{lm_2}\begin{pmatrix}
        2s-l&2s-l&1\\-m_1&m_2&m
    \end{pmatrix}+hn_{x,1m}
```
Here, $\tilde{U}_l$ are tuning parameters.
