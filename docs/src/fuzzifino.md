# Fuzzifino

Fuzzifino is a module for exact diagonalisation (ED) calculation on the fuzzy sphere for systems with both bosons and fermions. The usage is similar to FuzzifiED, with new types `SQNDiag`, `SQNOffd`, `SConf`, `SBasis`, `STerm` and `SOperator` defined. To use the module, include also at the start of your Julia script
```julia
using FuzzifiED.Fuzzifino
```

## Environment parameter

```@docs
Libpathino
```

## Quantum numbers

The diagonal and off-diagonal quantum numbers are implemented as
```@docs
SQNDiag
SQNOffd
```

## Configurations
```@docs
SConfs
```
It can be generated from the QNDiags.
```@docs
SConfs(nof :: Int64, nob :: Int64, nebm :: Int64, secd :: Vector{Int64}, qnd :: Vector{SQNDiag} ; num_th :: Int64 = NumThreads, disp_std :: Bool = !SilentStd)
```

## Basis
```@docs
SBasis
```
It can be generated by the following methods.
```@docs
SBasis(cfs :: SConfs, secf :: Vector{<:Number}, qnf :: Vector{SQNOffd} ; num_th = NumThreads, disp_std = !SilentStd)
SBasis(cfs :: SConfs)
```

## Term

```@docs
STerm
```
The product of terms with a number, the sum and product of terms, adjoint and particle-hole transformation are defined
```@docs
*(fac :: Number, tms :: Vector{STerm})
+(tms1 :: Vector{STerm}, tms2 :: Vector{STerm})
*(tms1 :: Vector{STerm}, tms2 :: Vector{STerm})
adjoint(tms :: Vector{STerm})
```
The terms can be simplified by 
```@docs
NormalOrder(tm :: STerm)
SimplifyTerms(tms :: Vector{STerm})
```

## Operator

```@docs
SOperator
```
It can be generated by the following methods.
```@docs
SOperator(bsd :: SBasis, bsf :: SBasis, terms :: Vector{STerm} ; red_q :: Int64 = 0, sym_q :: Int64 = 0)
```
The product of an operator on a state and the inner product of a final state, an operator and an initial state can be calculated by
```@docs
*(op :: SOperator, st_d :: Vector{ComplexF64} ; num_th = NumThreads, disp_std = !SilentStd)
*(st_fp :: LinearAlgebra.Adjoint{ComplexF64, Vector{ComplexF64}}, op :: SOperator, st_d :: Vector{ComplexF64} ; num_th = NumThreads, disp_std = !SilentStd)
```

## Sparse matrix

The OpMat can be generated from `SOperator` by the following methods.
```@docs
OpMat(op :: SOperator)
```
After the generation of sparse matrix, the diagonalisation can be condicted with FuzzifiED.

* [`test_boson.jl`](https://github.com/mankai-chow/FuzzifiED.jl/blob/main/examples/test_boson.jl) tests the nearest-neighbour tight-binding model $H=\sum_i(b^\dagger_ib_{i+1}+f^\dagger_if_{i+1}+\mathrm{h.c.})$. The example diagonalises the sector with the number of bosons and fermions both $N_o/2$, and even under the reflection with respect to a bond center $i\mapsto N_o+1-i$, and measures the total particle number squared $\left[\sum_i(b_i^\dagger b_i+f^\dagger_if_i)\right]^2$.
* [`ising_frac_boson.jl`](https://github.com/mankai-chow/FuzzifiED.jl/blob/main/examples/ising_frac_boson.jl) calculates the spectrum of 3d Ising model on fuzzy sphere for bosons at fractional filling ``Î½ = 1/2``. This example reproduces Figure 12a,b in arXiv:2411.15299.
